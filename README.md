# 💳 Fraud Detection Dashboard Project

🚨 This is an interactive and data-driven Fraud Detection Dashboard built as part of my summer training with **#AngaarBatch - LPU Flames 2025**.

Using real transaction data, I created a powerful dashboard in **Excel**, backed by **MySQL** queries to identify and visualize fraudulent activities.


## 📊 Features Included:
- Total Transactions, Fraud Count & Detection Accuracy
- Suspicious Transactions by Rules (High Amount, Timing, Country)
- Top Merchants and Locations with Fraud Patterns
- Filters for Device Type, Merchant & Location
- Dynamic Slicers and KPI Cards


## 🛠️ Tech Stack:
- **Excel (Pivot Tables, Slicers, Charts)**
- **MySQL (Workbench & SQL Views)**
- **ODBC Integration with Excel**


## 🔗 How It Works:
1. SQL Queries create views like:
   - `rule_based_suspects`
   - `fraud_dashboard_summary`
2. Data imported into Excel via **ODBC**
3. Interactive dashboard with KPIs, charts & filters
